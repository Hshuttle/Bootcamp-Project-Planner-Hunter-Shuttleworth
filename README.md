# Description

In this challenge we were tasked to create a workday planner that allowed us to plan out our day. The text entered into the text area fields is saved to the local storage by clicking the save icon and can be cleared by clicking the trash icon. The highlighted rows changes by the hour based on real time, with the past being gray, the present being pink and the future being purple. There is also a navbar added to the header that redirects to several useful tools and pages to add ease and convenience to the page.
